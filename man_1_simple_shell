.SH NAME
.B man page hsh.

This shell is a sh-compatible command language interpreter that execute commands from the standar input or from a file.
- A super-basic command line interpreter based on UNIX.
.SH SYNOPSYS
This interpreter was designed to run all the repository files, withGNU compiler version- "gcc 4.8.4" supported by "Ubuntu 14.04.05 LTS" and all its environment. When compile is done, the executable file clone a shell, exactly like the original shell does to access all services. Like the original system shell, this one have some built-in commands and also integrates other PATH ones.
The output is like original shell - system shell.

.SH DESCRIPTION
The shell is a program designed to interpret the user commands, so the commands are transformed in binary orders that our system can understand, if there a valid command this will be executed, otherwise we will get an error message.

.SH USAGE
All the files are going to be compiled with ubuntu 14.04 LTS machine, helped with this flags: "-pedantic -Werror -Wextra -Wall"...
"gcc -pedantic -Werror -Wextra -Wall *.c -o hsh"

Example:
.br
$ gcc -pedantic -Werror -Wextra -Wall *.c -o hsh

After that we obtain a ./hsh executable, now you can run the program: ./hsh

Example:
.br
$ ./hsh

To leave the programm type exit

Example:
.br
$ exit

.SH COMMANDS
If a command was recognized, the shell can do this:
.br
You can introduce a command in this way:
.br

command [arguments] or PATH [arguments]
.br

The shell will search the command, if get it, the command will be executed, otherwise it will return a error message indicating that is not a valid command.
